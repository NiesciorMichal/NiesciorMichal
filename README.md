## Hello there 👋
I'm Automation Engineer with programming fundamentals. 
In 2018, I graduated in Computer Science, Automation and Electronics presenting an engineering thesis entitled 
“Activity database for the purpose of classification” using SciKit Learn, SQLite, Numpy, Pandas. 

After graduation, I worked in the energy industry as a control and measurement instrumentation and automation engineer. 
This year I decided to return to programming focusing on ML/ Data Science working mainly in Linux environment using Docker.
